# Coding-Quiz

Hello and Welcome to my Coding Quiz Challenge!

I initially started with setting up my html boiler and adding in my header and main instructions paragraph.
After setting up my HTML I checked to see if it was good!

I than continued by adding in my css and javascript links before begining to work on them!
